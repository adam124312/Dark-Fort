### Gameplay
Gameplay feeling will include:
* hard decisions no option is good
    * sacrifices (decisions)
    * important resources are scarce, other resources are very abundant but much work is needed to gather them
        * different appearances for abundant resources e.g. food: carrots, meat, fish
    * things are pretty tough and repair is not profitable
    * player should get attached to units, like them / hate them
* constant stress, desperation
   * allies will try to deceive player, saying that they are friends and trying to act for their own good
   * everything is safe but has attacks that seem to happen at random
    * player under constant stress from slow-moving zombies, which are hard to kill
    * always something is too low (e.g. water)
    * it's very hard to do anything without using scarce resources
        * killing zombie withuot using ammo
        * inventing antidote without using potion or humans
* feeling of slow dying
    * everyone is hard to kill but easy to weaken, almost all have some disfunction all the time
    * zombies are very hard to kill
* many creatures don't attack, everyone fights for resources
* 2D Graphics will make players imagine, like in old games
