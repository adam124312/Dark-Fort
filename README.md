    * things are pretty tough and repair is not profitable
    * player should get attached to units, like them / hate them
* constant stress, desperation
   * allies will try to deceive player, saying that they are friends and trying to act for their own good
   * everything is safe but has attacks that seem to happen at random
    * player under constant stress from slow-moving zombies, which are hard to kill
    * always something is too low (e.g. water)
    * it's very hard to do anything without using scarce resources
        * killing zombie withuot using ammo
        * inventing antidote without using potion or humans
* feeling of slow dying
